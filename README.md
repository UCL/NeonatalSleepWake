## EEG_analysis

### Installation

To use the scripts and functions in EEG_analysis, clone this git repository (click the big green button on the top right of this page). Then, in Matlab, add the path to the EEG_analysis directory into the path variable with the `addpath` function.

### Usage

The user should mostly interact with the scripts `eeg_visualisations.m`, `eeg_batch.m` and `development_outcome_correlation.m`. See the comments in each file for their purpose. The scripts can be launched on the command line, or in the editor. They will open GUI windows when user input is required.
